// Elvis operator is a conditional operator that handles `null`. It evaluates an expression
// and if the value is `null`, it executes the second expression.
//
// The elvis operator takes two operands and uses the '?:' symbol to form it as shown in the syntax below.
//      `expression ?: expressionIfNull`
