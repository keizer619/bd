// The `any` data type is the root of the Ballerina data types. It can represent a variable of any data type.
// When you do not have prior knowledge of the data type of your variable, you can assign `any` as the type.
// Values of these variables can come from dynamic content such as the request and response messages and the user input.
// The `any` type allows you to skip compile-time data type checks.
