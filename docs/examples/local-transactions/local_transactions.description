// A Ballerina transaction is a series of data manipulation statements 
// that must either fully complete or fully fail, thereby leaving the
// system in a consistent state. This sample uses MySQL DB. Before running the
// sample, copy the `MySQL JDBC driver` to the `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` folder
// and change the DB connection properties as required.
