// The Ballerina JDBC Client is used to access and manipulate data in relational
// databases. For MYSQL and H2 you could use corresponding MYSQL and H2 clients
// implemented specifically for each of them.
// This sample uses MySQL DB. Before running the sample, copy the
// MySQL JDBC driver to the `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` folder and change the DB connection
// properties as required.
