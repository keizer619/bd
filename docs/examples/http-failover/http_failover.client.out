# To invoke the Failover Service, use following curl command.
$ curl -v http://localhost:9090/fo
# The `FailoverClient` endpoint is configured with three target services.The first two targets are configured to mimic
# failure backends. If one target service goes down, the failover client automatically calls the other targets.
# Once you invoke the Failover demo service, the Failover client fails over the request to the configured
# target endpoints. In this example, the third target is configured to give a successful request and the following 
# response is given when the failover demo service is invoked.
# Server response:
Mock Resource is Invoked.
