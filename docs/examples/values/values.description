// Ballerina programs operate on a universe of values, and each value belongs to only one basic type
// such as int, boolean, map, record, function, etc. There are three kinds of values
// corresponding to three kinds of basic types. They are simple values (e.g., int, string, boolean),
// structured values (e.g., record, map, array), and behavioral values (e.g., function, object).
