// A JSON can be constrained with a record definition to restrict the fields of the JSON to that of the
// record. If you try to access a field with an invalid field as per the record definition or initialize
// a JSON with invalid fields, this will cause a compilation error. Restricting the fields of the JSON will
// enforce the format of the JSON variable.
